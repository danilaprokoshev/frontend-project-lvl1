## About

Brain Games is my educational project that I performed during the studying on [hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io/professions) (project level 1).

Brain Games is a set of five console-games. Each game asks questions expecting right answers back. Three right answers mean that game is passed. Wrong answers finish game and suggest trying it again.

**Games**:
* Calculator. Do some simple calculations.
* Progression. Find skipped element in sequence of numbers.
* Conclude whether given number is even or not.
* Find the greatest common divisor of given numbers.
* Conclude whether given number is prime or not.

**Example**:

```
May I have your name: Joe
Hello, Joe!
What number is missing in the progression?
Question: 38 43 48 .. 58 63
Your answer: 53
Correct!
Question: 44 47 50 .. 56 59
Your answer: 53
Correct!
Question: .. 27 31 35 39 43 47 51
Your answer: 23
Correct!
Congratulations, Joe!
```
